# WolfEngine
## About
**WolfEngine** is an open source task process optimizing engine for exploratory data analysis using workflow design. 
With an automated system operation, combining dynamic optimization and asynchronous calculation techniques give rise to faster calculation speed. Wolf Engine  also enables you to automatically optimize your software without revising original source code.

WolfEngine is being actively developed by NoteSquare Inc. which first started the idea to combine many different machine learning algorithms in different libraries. Now, NoteSquare Inc. uses WolfEngine in many task-oriented jobs in various environment.

## Characteristics
* Dramatically increase calculation speed 
* Effectively decrease time in development cycle
* Efficiently utilize computer resources 
* Considerably reduce hardware maintenance costs
* **No NEED** to revise original source code 
* **No NEED** to learn optimization skills 

## Features
* Auto-Parallelization 
* Auto-Generator
    * Enabling the software to use low memory footprint for heavy input data, are supported.
* Auto-IO-Cache
    * Caching the task based on its input and output data ensures the fast computation and also pause and continue of the long-running task pipelines.
* Auto-Scheduler 
    * Scrutinizing the most adaptive optimization techniques based on  user's computing environment.
