# WolfEngine
## About
**WolfEngine** is an open source task process optimizing engine for exploratory data analysis using workflow design. 
Wolf Engine combines dynamic optimization and asynchronous calculation techniques with an automated system operation. Wolf Engine enables you to automatically optimize your software without revising original source code.

## Characteristics
* Dramatically increase calculation speed 
* Effectively decrease time in development cycle
* Efficiently utilize computer resources 
* Considerably reduce hardware maintenance costs
* **No NEED** to revise original source code 
* **No NEED** to learn optimization skills 

## Features
* Auto-Parallelization 
* Auto-Generator 
* Auto-IO-Cache
* Auto-Scheduler 
    * Scrutinizing the most adaptive optimization techniques based on  user's computing environment.

## How does it works?
